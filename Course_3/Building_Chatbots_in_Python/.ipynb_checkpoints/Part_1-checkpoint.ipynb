    "Messaging and voice-controlled devices are the next big platforms, and conversational computing has a big role to play in creating engaging augmented and virtual reality experiences. This course will get you started on the path toward building such applications. There are a number of unique challenges to building these kinds of programs, like how do I turn human language into instructions for machines? In this course, you'll tackle this first with rule-based systems and then with machine learning. Some chat systems are designed to be useful, while others are just good fun. You will build one of each and put everything together to make a helpful, friendly chatbot. Once you complete the course, youâ€™ll also learn how to connect your chatbot to Facebook Messenger!"

    "## 1. Introduction to conversational software\n",
    "Hello, and welcome to this course on chatbots and conversational software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. A short history\n",
    "Conversational software is not a new idea! In fact, the invention of the keyboard+video screen terminal brought on the first wave of command line apps in the 1960s. To use a command line app, you have to type instructions using a language that's very strict, but already much closer to human language than the underlying machine instructions. Around the same time, the ELIZA program was created. This now famous program was able to hold a conversation by using a rule-matching engine. Despite the relatively simple code behind ELIZA, it's actually a pretty compelling conversationalist. In this chapter you will build up your own, minimal version of the ELIZA chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Course content\n",
    "In the following chapters, you will learn how use regular expressions, as well as machine learning to extract meaning from free-form text. You will build chatbots that can query a database for you, plan a trip, and help you order coffee. You will see that often, the tricky part of building more complicated bots is to keep track of the _state_ of the conversation. You'll first learn techniques for avoiding this statefulness, which is usually the easiest solution. Later, you'll learn how to handle state in the cases where you really have to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. EchoBot I\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first set of exercises, you'll start with the basics. The first bot you'll build is called EchoBot, because it simply echoes back to you whatever you say to it. For simplicity, all the bots you build in this course will receive messages in python code, and will print their responses to the screen. At the end of the course we will provide you with some python code for connecting your bots to various messaging apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. EchoBot II\n",
    "\n",
    "To build an echobot you need to define a `respond` function, which takes a message as an argument and returns an appropriate response. Here we define a function using the keyword `def`, then the name of the function, then its arguments in parentheses, and then a colon. The body of the function is indented by one level. We specify the output generated by the function using the `return` keyword. If a function doesn't have a `return` statement, that means it returns a `NoneType`. One way we can insert variables into a string in python is by using the string's `format` method. Inside the respond function is a string containing curly brackets. These act as placeholders, and will get replaced by the value of the argument we pass when we call `format`. To keep track of everything that's being said, we'll define another function called `send_message` which prints what the user just said, gets the response by calling the respond function, and then prints the bots response as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. EchoBot III\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when we know we're talking to a bot, it can feel a little strange to see a response come back immediately. It just doesn't feel natural. We can create an artificial delay by importing the `time` module, and running time dot sleep, passing the number of seconds to wait as an argument. In this example we've created a half-second delay.\n",

    "### 1. Creating a personality\n",
    "Creating an engaging personality is a fun and absolutely crucial part of chatbot development. It's one of the key differences compared to any other kind of software\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why personality?\n",
    "So why bother with a personality? If all you could do was type precise instructions to your bot, you would actually just have a command line application, not a chatbot. Most chatbots are embedded in a messaging app that people are comfortable using to talk to their friends. And you can expect that straightaway your users will want to make a bit of smalltalk, often before trying out any 'functionality' that they came for. It's not much effort to code up some responses to common questions, and is worth it for the improved user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Smalltalk\n",
    "The simplest thing we can do is use a python dictionary, with user messages as the keys and responses as the values. For example, here we define a dictionary called `responses`, with the messages `\"what's your name?\"` and `\"what's today's weather\"` as keys, and suitable responses as values. Next, we define a function called `respond`, which accepts a message as a single argument. This function tests if a message has a defined response by using the `in` keyword, that is \"if message in responses\". This statement only returns `True` if the message corresponds to one of the keys in the dictionary. Notice that this will only work if the user's message *exactly* matches a key in the dictionary. In later chapters you will build much more robust solutions. Notice that if there isn't a matching message, the `return` keyword will never be reached, so the function will return None.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Including variables\n",
    "Since the world outside is always changing, your bot's answers have to be able to as well. The first thing you can do is add some placeholders to the responses. For example, instead of `\"The weather is sunny\"`, you can have a template string, like `\"it's {} today\"`. Then later, you can insert a variable `weather_today` by calling format weather today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Choosing responses\n",
    "Now, it quickly gets dull hearing the same responses over and over again, so it's a very good idea to add a little variety! To return completely different responses, we can replace the values in the responses dictionary with lists. Then when you're choosing a response, you can randomly select an answer from the appropriate list. To do this, import random, and use the random dot choice function, passing the list of options as an argument. For now, we're still relying on the user message matching our predefined messages *exactly*, but we'll soon move to a more flexible approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Asking questions\n",
    "A great way to keep users engaged is to ask them questions, or invite them to go into more detail. This was actually one of the things which made the ELIZA bot so fun to talk to. Instead of using a bland default message like \"I'm sorry, I didn't understand you\", you can use some phrases that invite further conversation. Questions are a great way to achieve this. \"Why do you think that?\", \"How long have you felt this way?\", and \"Tell me more!\" are appropriate responses to many different kinds of message, and even when they don't quite match are more entertaining than a boring fallback."

    "### 1. Text processing with regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are a powerful tool for processing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use them for matching messages against known patterns, for extracting key phrases, and for transforming sentences grammatically. These are the core pieces we need to create our ELIZA style bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The regex behind ELIZA\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the magic of the ELIZA system relied on giving the _impression_ that the bot had understood you, even though the underlying logic was extremely simple. For example, asking ELIZA \"do you remember when you ate strawberries in the garden?\", she would respond: \"How could I forget when I ate strawberries in the garden?\". Part of what makes this example so compelling is the subject. We are asking about _memories_, which we associate with our conscious minds and our sense of self. The memory itself, of eating strawberries in the garden, invokes powerful emotions. But if we pick apart how the response is generated, we see that it's actually quite simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Pattern matching\n",
    "\n",
    "To build an ELIZA-like system you need a few key components. The first is a simple pattern matcher. This consist of a set of rules for matching user messages, like \"do you remember x\" To match patterns we use a technology called *regular expressions*, to use these in python we `import re`. Regular expressions are a way to define patterns of characters, and then seeing if those patterns occur in a string. In regular expressions, the dot character is special, and matches *any* character. The asterisk means \"match 0 or more occurrences of this pattern\", so \"dot star\" is basically a catch-all, it says match any string of characters. We can check whether a message matches a pattern by calling re dot search brackets pattern comma message. This returns a match object. If the string doesn't match the pattern, the match object will be `None`, so we can check if the string matches using a simple if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Extracting key phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding parentheses in the pattern string defines a `group`. A group is just a substring that we can retrieve after matching the string against the pattern. We use the match object's `group` method to retrieve the parts of the string that matched. The default group, with index 0, is the whole string. The group with index one is the group we defined by including the parentheses in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Grammatical transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "To make responses grammatically coherent, we will want to transform the extracted phrases from first to second person and vice versa. In English, conjugating verbs is easy, and simply swapping \"I\" and \"you\", \"my\" and \"your\" works in most cases. We can use another function from the `re` module for this: `re.sub`. This substitutes patterns in a string. For example, take the sentence \"I walk my dog\". re.sub \"You walk your dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to combine these logical pieces together. We start with a pattern and a message. We extract the key phrase by creating a match object using pattern dot search, and then use the group method to extract the string represented by the parentheses. We then choose a response appropriate to this pattern, and swap the pronouns so that the phrase makes sense when the bot says it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "We then insert the extracted phrase into the response, to partially echo back what the user talked about, giving the illusion that the bot has understood the question and remembers this experience."
